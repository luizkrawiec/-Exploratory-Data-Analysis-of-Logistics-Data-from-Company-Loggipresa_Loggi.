The purpose of the project was to address common challenges faced by logistics companies, such as optimizing delivery routes and efficiently allocating deliveries to fleet vehicles, considering their limited capacities. The data used was synthesized from public sources such as IBGE, IPEA, among others, and reflects the daily challenges faced by the startup, particularly regarding its scale.
During the project, we completed several stages, such as data collection, data wrangling, schema, and moving on to data manipulation with data enrichment. We verified data quality to avoid the risk of ineffective analysis. After this process, I would like to emphasize that we started from a JSON file with 200 lines and transformed it into a pandas dataframe with 636,149 lines.
